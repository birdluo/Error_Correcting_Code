# Error_Correcting_Code
The aim of the work is to produce a circuit able to code and encode using Hamming code on 11 bits. The circuit is described using VHDL hardware description language.

## About 
This work has been realized in University of Pisa/Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in the context of Digital Systems exam.
